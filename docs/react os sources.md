## React os sources
To change the [LOCALE_IREADINGLAYOUT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/locale-ireadinglayout) I opened the sources of [[react os]] and changed [this file](https://github.com/reactos/reactos/blob/master/dll/win32/kernel32/winnls/nls/heb.nls) and compiled the system.

It did not change the direction of the text, but it was fun compiling it :)
