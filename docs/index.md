# werbeh
This is a program to reverse the direction of right to left languages.

Meaning instead of writing שלום we would write םולש as we would do with english (the characters will be automatically formated to the left) , and the letters will be inverted.

## Desclaimer
This project does not work and will not work.
I used the idea to learn about text parsing and read some c/c++ sources (which is always nice). 

## Reason for creating the repo
After all this is not gonna work, but I want to:
- Preserve my research for myself and my future possible usage
- Help curious mind like me to have the exact reasoning
- I created the docs anyway so why not?

Reading list:

- [[initial research]]
- [[Operating system reasearch]]
- [[react os#React os sources|React Os Sources]]
- [[break point]]
- [[unicode library]]

The docs are generated using [publish-mkdocs](https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-publish-mkdocs)
