After all that (and the fact that this research started to get old) I went to read to sources of a library that does text processing and displaying it.

Long story short, this library imported a library that had a list of unicode characters that should be inverted (rtl), and a reference to the [unicode bidi specification](https://unicode.org/reports/tr9).

I finally found it! I can go to rest now.
