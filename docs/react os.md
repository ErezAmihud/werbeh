## React os
React os is an open source operating system that is built on top of the windows architecture and official api/docs.
The system contains an oprational system and source codes for multiple parts that act like the windows os.

The project is a little bit behind the actuall windows distrubution (it is more like windows xp/7 than windows 10), which is actually a bonus for some parts of this research.
