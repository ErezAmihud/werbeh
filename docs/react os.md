## React os
React os is an open source operating system that is built on top of the windows architecture and official api/docs.
The system contains an oprational system and source codes for multiple parts that act like the windows os.

The project is a little bit behind the actuall windows distrubution (it is more like windows xp/7 than windows 10), which is actually a bonus for some parts of this research.

## React os sources
To change the [LOCALE_IREADINGLAYOUT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/locale-ireadinglayout) I opened the sources of [[react os#React os|react os]] and changed [this file](https://github.com/reactos/reactos/blob/master/dll/win32/kernel32/winnls/nls/heb.nls) and compiled the system.

It did not change the direction of the text, but it was fun compiling it :)
